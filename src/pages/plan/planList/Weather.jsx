          Thailand is located between vast areas of land and water, so it is
          impacted by both the summer and the winter monsoons. As a result,
          Thailand weather consists of six months of rainfalls during the wet
          season, three months of dry and cooling breezes during the winter, and
          three months of heat during the summer. The average temperature of
          Thailand ranges from 18 to 38Â°C.
