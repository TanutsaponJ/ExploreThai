            Thailand's nakhon Ratchasima and nakhon Nayok. Escape the mundane,
            unwind, and let nature rejuvenate your weary body and soul. After
            five busy workdays, everyone deserves a well-earned rest. Rejuvenate
            amidst the pristine nature of northeastern Thailand and let it
            replenish your energy. nakhon Ratchasima, also known as Korat, is a
            favored resort town among those residing in the central region of
            Thailand. Within a convenient two-hour drive, you can immerse
            yourself in the embrace of Mother nature at Khao Yai national park â€“
            Thailand's first national park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and an
            ASEAN Heritage Park. Khao Yai national park sprawls across four
            provinces: nakhon Ratchasima, Saraburi, prachinburi, and Nakhon
            Nayok. This sanctuary is a wildlife haven and home to over 280 bird
            species. Prepare to be awestruck by the array of attractions,
            including cascading waterfalls, viewpoints over the cliffs, wildlife
            observatories, and a picturesque Reservoir. Highlights include Haew
            Narok waterfall, Haew SuWat waterfall, Pha Diew Dai Viewpoint, Khao
            Kheow viewpoint (Pha Tromjai), Nong Phak Chi wildlife observation
            tower, and Lam Ta Khong camping ground. With seven short walking
            trails and winter stargazing, Khao Yai beckons every nature
            enthusiast and adventurer with various activities and attractions.
            After enjoying your time in Korat, drive to nakhon Nayok, a
            second-tier province offering a laid-back lifestyle and pristine
            scenery. Take advantage of Khao Chong Lom, a popular attraction for
            Travel bloggers, especially during the vibrant green season. With
            the Reservoir's water at a low level from the last dry season, and
            the recent rains bringing life to the land, you'll be treated to a
            picturesque green valley with stunning water streams and waterfalls.
            Cruise along the stream to fully immerse yourself in the
            jaw-dropping beauty of the lush landscape, and let the fresh air and
            astounding views rejuvenate your mind. Make sure to visit a renowned
            Temple in nakhon Nayok, Wat Chulabhorn Wanaram, and its iconic
            Bamboo Tunnel. The Temple attracts visitors who come to pay homage
            and make merit, while the majestic bamboo grove lining the 800-meter
            walkway to the temple entrance captivates all. While the Bamboo
            Tunnel makes for a perfect postcard shot, the serene feeling of
            standing amidst the vast bamboo grove truly leaves a lasting
            impression. Don't waste your weekend in the humdrum rhythm of your
            nine-to-five routine. Break free from the City and let Mother nature
            work her magic. She'll tenderly brush away your stress and create
            countless happy memories to brighten your days.
