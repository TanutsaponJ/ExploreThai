            November is the exact month of the Cool season. The temperature of
            all parts of Thailand has decreased, and it’ll be so low that we’ll
            have to nudge the person beside us to greet the cold weather at many
            tourist attractions. You can go up North to touch the beauty of the
            nature, mountains and national parks as well as the full blossom at
            Thung Bua Tong. Then, go through the Northeast and the upper part of
            the Central Region, climb up to the top of the mountains to be
            impressed with the nice atmosphere and fresh breeze. Then, head down
            to the south to enjoy water activities, Taking photos and exploring
            the aquatic species.

            When the Cool season starts, it’s the time for many people who
            really want to put on their favourite sweaters and go out for a
            Trip. Let’s start by viewing the picturesque scenery and absorbing
            the atmosphere among the mountains and the mist at Huai Nam Dang
            national park, Chiang Mai province. Even though the temperature
            there is around 14° Celsius; there are also some hot springs for
            warming up your body or you can Travel to Phu Ruea national park and
            Phu Suan Sai, Loei province, which is quite cold with frost forming.
            However, no matter how cold it is, many people are still waiting in
            a long line to set up their tents and view the beauty of the sunrise
            and Sunset. Besides what you have been told, there are also some
            remarkable waterfalls for you to appreciate their beauty there.

            During the cold season, in case you want to visit and Take photos at
            a floral site to reboot your mind and body, we recommend Tung Bua
            Tong Field, Doi Mae U, Mae Hong Son province. It can be said that
            this is the largest Bua Tong(Mexican sunfolwer) Field in Thailand.
            Blooming yellow Bua Tong can be seen, and visitors can enjoy taking
            photos there. During its festival, tourists can join many activities
            and buy some Local products to take home as a souvenirs.

            It’s not true if anyone thinks that a sea Trip is impossible in the
            Cool season. Because in November, there’s no more monsoon on the
            Andaman coast so the picturesque scenery, colourful and lively
            atmosphere of these attractions return. A number of tourists, both
            Thai and foreigners gather around especially in Krabi, a province
            which is named ‘Queen of the Andaman’ because of its beautiful sea,
            clear water and abundant nature. There are many islands; such as, ko
            Rok, Ko Phi Phi, Ko Kai, Ko Pho Da, Ko Tao, etc. which you can enjoy
            swimming, Taking photos and admiring coral reefs. Another choice for
            having a Trip is satun, a small province with extraordinary nature
            and sea, and it’s also surrounded by beautiful islands; such as, Mu
            Ko Phetra national park, Ko Tarutao, Ko Adang, Ko Ra-wi, Ko Li-pe,
            etc.

            The highlighted festival held in November is the Loi Krathong
            Festival, which the Local people and tourists gather around to pay
            respect and apologise to the Goddess of Water or the River. This
            gigantic festival is held in every province throughout Thailand; for
            instance: in Tak, there is the Tak Loi Krathong Sai Festival and a
            Thousand Floating Lanterns; in Chiang Mai, the Yi Peng Lantern
            Festival;[1] in Sukhothai, the Sukhothai Loi Krathong and Candle

            November every single year.
