            According to the fact that February is the beginning of the hot
            season, it’s not surprising that sea and Beaches are the most
            favourite attractions whether it be the Gulf of Thailand or the
            AnDaman sea, the east and west of the southern region. There are
            lots of choices . The places which aren’t too far from Bangkok
            include Ko Lam, Ko Si Chang and Ko Samae San in Chon Buri province;
            Hua Hin Beach, Cha-Am Beach, Ban Krut Beach and Suan Son Pradipat in
            Prachuap Khiri Khan province. There are also many choices for
            tourists who want to visit the Eastern region to choose; such as, Ko
            Chang, Ko Kut, Ko Mak and Ko Kham in Trat province, Mueang Ko
            Krueang Roi. Without a doubt, each place is gorgeous because of its
            atmosphere, fine white sand, clear water, challenging water
            activities, the abundance of the underwater world and Local people’s
            way of life. Anyone who is interested in the southern region should
            start packing and just buy only a one-way ticket, and a ticket for a
            return Trip can be bought later because the experience at the
            AnDaman sea is so extraordinary that you’ll definitely want to
            extend your Trip and you might have thrown away your return ticket
            if you had already bought one. Some fantastic places are Ko Tachai,
            Koh Ko Similan, Mu Ko surin, Ko Tapu and many more in Phang nga; Nai
            Han Beach, Karon Beach, Ko Racha, Ko Hae, Ko Mai Ton and others in
            Phuket. These islands and beaches are abundant in natural resources
            from little clown fish to giant whales, which are there to welcome
            every single tourist.
