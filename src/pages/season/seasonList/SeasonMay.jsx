            season, which starts from mid-May. Among the six regions of
            Thailand, the southern region has the highest rainfall. The most
            popular types of Tourism in May are Ecotourism and cultural tourism.

            Let’s end this summer with a Trip to the satun Geopark museum in
            Satun province, a place with abundant natural resources that has
            been approved as the first UNESCO Global Geopark in Thailand. At the
            satun geopark Museum, there’s a wide range of activities for you to
            participate: Rafting, diving, caving, or recreational excursions to
            a waterfall and a Beach. There’s also a place where you can buy
            souvenirs and community products and experience the Local Culture.
            Another interesting activity is the Fruit Buffet Festival that will
            be held every year. Many of the fruit orchards are open to visitors.
            This EVENT has become one of the most popular attractions for both
            Thai and foreign tourists who love fruit. You can enjoy the Fruit
            Buffet at the following orchards that we recommend. Starting with
            Rayong province, the first one is Suan Lamai, an orchard that offers
            not only a seasonal fruit Buffet, but also a coffee shop and natural
            pet-friendly camp. The second is Suphattra Land where you can also
            buy OTOP products, especially our recommended durian cake. The third
            one is Suan Lung Thongbai, a famous orchard of which one of its
            signature menus is homemade durian ice cream. Next is Chanthaburi
            that has KP Garden. If you visit KP Garden, don’t forget to try the
            famous Stir-Fried Rice Noodles with Crab meat and enjoy Cycling
            activities and free goat feeding.

            Last but not least, let’s go to Suan Durian Land in Chanthaburi, in
            addition to the Buffet of fresh fruits, there is cozy Accommodation
            with a mountain view, a coffee shop, and an area for Adventure
            activities, which is perfect for a colourful Trip. After filling our
            stomach, we continue our trip to Kaeng Krachan national park in
            Phetchaburi, where we can be among thousands of butterflies in a
            cozy atmosphere because it’s during the butterfly watching season.
            If anyone wants to see butterflies while camping, May is the perfect
            month to begin your Trip because there will be the largest butterfly
            migration. Sometimes the number of butterflies that migrates can be
            over a 100,000 with more than 200 species. After this period, the
            number of butterflies will start to decrease. You can also see the
            sea of mist at Khao Phanoen Thung in Kaeng Krachan national park.

            Let’s bid farewell to this summer in nakhon Si Thammarat by getting
            on a Boat and setting out to see pink dolphins at Laem Prathap and
            Kwang Pao Bay. These spots are the habitat of more than 50 pink
            dolphins. Visitors can Travel by Boat to see them closely. However,
            we don’t recommend buying fish Food or fish from the shore because
            it may cause the dolphins to change their eating habits. After a
            long Trip, let’s Relax at our last stop: the Rajjaprabha Dam in Khao
            Sok district, Surat Thani province, or widely known as the Guilin of
            Thailand. The Dam is located in the area of Khao Sok national park.
            Thanks to its natural abundance, this place has a very beautiful
            atmosphere like heaven on Earth, especially at this time of the
            year. The weather is also great because it’s the end of summer and
            the beginning of the rainy season.
