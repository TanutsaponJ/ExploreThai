            Thailand’s weather gets coldest in January, especially in the
            mountains of the Northern and Northeastern region. Meanwhile, in
            other regions, there are some Cool and fresh breezes as well. Since
            the weather is so good, let’s explore the popular tourist
            attractions of this month, starting from viewing the sea of mist on
            top of the mountain and admiring beautiful blooming Flowers like
            Wild Himalayan Cherry Blossom or widely known as Thai Sakura which
            turns everything into pink at Doi Ang Khang, doi inthanon, Phu Lom
            Lo, etc.

            In January, the Northern region of Thailand is the most popular
            tourist Destination because of Doi or mountains and hills located
            all over the region. Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Mae Hong Son, etc., are
            all perfect for hiking and camping in the cold winter breeze. Our
            recommended destinations for January, famous for their beauty and
            nature, are Doi Ang Khang, doi inthanon, Doi Luang Chiang Dao, Phu
            Chi Fah, etc.

            Apart from the mountains, the North of Thailand in January also has
            tourist spots where all visitors will be welcomed by dazzling
            beautiful flower fields; such as, Mae Fah Luang Garden, Royal Park
            Rajapruek, Doi Ang Khang, etc. There’s also a special highlight that
            can be seen only in January: Wild Himalayan Cherry Blossom or Thai
            Sakura, found only at Doi Ang Khang and doi inthanon in Chiang Mai
            province. During this time of the year, you’ll get to see not only
            the sea of mist on top of the mountains, but also the sight of fog
            floating above the water in the morning at the Royal Forest Project
            at Pang Tong 2 or Pang Ung in Mae Hong Son province. Therefore, if
            you want to experience the fun of Adventure, hiking, camping in the
            cold winter and admiring the fascinating beauty of nature, the
            Northern region of Thailand in January is the perfect Destination
            for you.

            Let’s move to the northeastern part of Thailand in January. The
            mountains in this region are as beautiful as those in the Northern
            region we’ve visited.One of the most popular destinations is Phu
            Kradueng, a great mountain with cliffs, waterfalls, viewpoints and
            interesting activities for you to enjoy; for example, walking or
            biking along the nature trails, playing in waterfalls and
            stargazing. A highlight of this month is viewing the red maple
            leaves found at the Tham Yai waterfall and Pen Pop Mai Waterfall. Or
            if you want to be surrounded by the sea of mist and get close to
            nature without sweating, you can visit Phu Ruea and Phu Tok as well.
            Their beauty is also incomparable. Isan or the Northeastern region
            has its own Wild Himalayan Cherry Blossom or Thai Sakura, too. You
            can find them at Phu Lom Lo in Loei province, a famous Destination
            known as Pink Valley or the Land of Thai Sakura.

            In January, the weather and tourist attraction styles of the Eastern
            and southern parts of Thailand are similar. The highlight of these
            two regions is the sea. The Eastern and Upper south regions’ sea is
            the Gulf of Thailand while the lower part of the southern region’s
            sea is a part of the Andaman Sea. January is an ideal time to go to
            the Beach at both the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea because
            of their clear water, bright blue sky, fresh and Cool air, which is
            perfect for every kind of water activities like swimming, diving,
            Snorkelling, scuba diving, sea kayaking, surfboarding, etc. It can
