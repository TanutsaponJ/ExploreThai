            July is a month of the rainy season. The atmosphere is rainy, moist
            and cool. Every water resource is filled again, perfect for a
            challenging activity which is popular among both Thai and foreign
            tourists: Rafting. In a flooding season like this, the more water,
            the more fun and challenge. Our recommended places for Rafting are
            Kaeng Lam Phachi in Suan Phueng district, Ratchaburi province, and
            Kaeng Sam Chan in nakhon Nayok province of which the difficulty
            ranges between normal to moderate.

            For July’s fruit festival, some orchards in Chanthaburi are still
            open for visitors to taste their fresh and delicious fruit; such as,
            rambutan, mangosteen, langsat, etc. Popular dishes of the rainy
            season are hot soups like chicken soup, sour soup or black sesame
            dumplings in ginger tea to boost your immune system.

            Speaking of festivals and traditions in this month, one of the
            highlights is the Candle Festival on the Buddhist Lent Day. This
            ancient festival has been held since the Buddha’s era. In every
            province of Thailand, large candles will be cast and offered to
            different temples. Also, in some provinces, those candles will be
            magnificently carved for this festival. One of the most famous is
            Thung Sri Muang Park in Ubon Ratchathani province, which has won a
            candle carving contest. In addition, on the same day, Thai people in
            Saraburi province will attend the Festival of Floral Offerings at
            Wat Phra Phutthabat, Phra Phutthabat district, Saraburi. This grand
            festival can be seen only at this place and during this month.
