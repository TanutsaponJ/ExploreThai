            ko Tachai, Phang nga is fantastic, especially from February to
            April. After this period, Ko Tachai will be closed for 6 months
            because of the monsoon. The highlight is taking a walk along the
            white sandy Beach, Trekking into the forest to see crabs named the
            “Chicken Crab” and dive to see the corals. So, don’t miss out!

            Another ko (Island) that you have to visit, and it’s one in the
            world list of best attractions is Ko Phi Phi, Krabi province. This
            phenomenal Island has been named “The Emerald of the AnDaman
            Paradise Phi Phi” which originates from the two outstanding and
            unique bars of Tonsai Bay and Loh Dalum. The clear emerald waters
            that surround the powdery white sandy Beach of Maya Bay including
            the coral reefs and other colourful marine species under the water
            awaits tourists to explore. The best time to visit is from February
            to April, which are the driest months. The next place we’re going to
            recommend and it’s so gorgeous for coral divers is Mu Ko surin, the
            most beautiful shallow coral reef habitat in Thailand and also the
            habitat of the rarely- seen clownfish and sea turtles. Therefore,
            during the hot season, don’t miss to appreciate the beauty of Mu Ko
            surin. The ideal time to visit is from November to April.

            Other than the sea, there are other places to try. In April, there’s
            the Songkran Festival, an old traditional festival of Thailand.
            Where people splash water at each other. There are many popular
            places in our list for participating in the Songkran Festival.
            Starting from Bangkok, siam Square, Khao San Road and Silom Road are
            where teenagers gather here to enjoy the Songkran Festival and join
            in other activities arranged by the public sector. Go to the North,
            Chiang Mai is absolutely a well-known province.A large number of
            tourists, both Thais and foreigners, along the City moat to splash
            water on people. The next place is Bang Saen. Think of Bang Saen,
            think of “Wan Lai” the flowing festival. People enjoy splashing
            water and swimming. The place where northeasterners usually gather
            must be Thanon Khao Niao, Khon Kaen province. The province
            celebrates this festival to respect Phra Phuttha Phra Lap, the
            respected Buddha image of the Khon Kaen people. People also offer
            alms to monks and bathe the Buddha image. This place provides a full
            set for a perfect Trip for visitors. At the southern region, there
            is very famous place to visit. That place is Patong Beach, Phuket
            province. This place is lively with tourists from everywhere in the
            world. There’s a procession of Phra Buddha Sihing moving around the
            beach for people to pay respect. Traditional Ramwong and Phuket
            traditional CUISINE are arranged at the beach as well. These are the
            reasons why it’s the most popular place for the southerners.

            Besides the sea and splashing of water of the Songkran Festival,
            there’s another remarkable place that’s open for the public in this
            month only. It’s Wat Tai Nam (Underwater Temple), Sangkhla Buri,
            Kanchanaburi province. The old underwater Ubosot of Wat Wang
            Wiwekaram is a well-known tourist attraction. When the water level
            is low, the beauty of this underwater ancient place will appear
            before tourists’ eyes. The best time for the one who has never
            visited this Underwater Temple is around March to April because the
            water level in the Dam is the lowest, and it’s fantastic to
            experience this rarely-seen view. Another must-see place is Prasat
            Hin Phanom Rung, Buri Ram province. It’s a Khmer-style ancient
            Temple complex situated significantly on the top of an extinct
            volcano. After its restoration, the pieces were combined together,
            and all the centres of the temple’s doors were set in the same
            direction. Every year, we can experience this natural phenomena,
            which the rays of the sunrise and the Sunset shine through all of
            the 15 portals of the temple only 4 times in March, October, April
            and September. This is an astonishing experience that is rarely to
            be seen.
