            Start the rainy season Trip by admiring a floral field at the siam
            Tulip field, one of the most-visited places. These beautiful pink
            Flowers are blooming annually only in the rainy season. The best
            spot in the country to view the beauty of these Flowers is Pha Hin
            Ngam national park in Chaiyaphum province. Not only is there the
            stunning natural scenery, OTOP products are also for sale. For all
            Adventure lovers, the only recreational activity that can be thought
            of is Rafting. A large amount of water in this season is absolutely
            perfect for rafting. However, please contact the officers for safety
            instructions.

            Let’s see where you can go for River Rafting.“ Khek River Rafting,
            Phitsanulok province” is quite gorgeous. The highlights are the
            three rapids as follows: Kaeng Chang, which its level of water gets
            continuously lower from the starting point, and there will be an
            unexpected sharp left turn but this is the beginning of the
            excitement; Kaeng Nang koi, which you have to be careful with the
            paddles because this area is full of big rocks, and Kaeng Yao, which
            its name originated from its 100-metre long distance with a sudden
            ramp. And if these aren’t challenging enough, let’s continue onto
            Hin Phueng, prachinburi province. The Trip here is rubber Boat
            Rafting, which travellers can navigate on along the clean light
            green rough stream at the difficulty levels of 3-5. There are 7
            rapids; namely, Kaeng Hin Phueng, Kaeng Phak Nam Lom, Kaeng Wang
            Yao, Kaeng Luk Suea, Kaeng Wang Bond, Kaeng Wang Sai and Kaeng Ngu
            Hao, and the total distance from the start to the end of the route
            is around 4.5 kilometres. The next site we recommend is “Rafting
            along the nakhon Nayok River, nakhon Nayok province”. The difficulty
            levels are 3-5. This is an activity which all genders and all ages
            can have fun. The rapids we raft along are Kaeng Khot Kung with some
            emerging rocks that we can see during the dry season and they are
            under water during the rainy season. ko Kang is also the same. The
            last rapid which is also the highlight of this Rafting is Kaeng Hin
            Sam Chan. Because of the sharp turn, which is on the way and not far
            from Kaeng Hin Sam Chan,paddlers must be aware and know how to
            control their paddles. Kaeng Sam Chan is 50 metres long with
            three-level islets which look like stairs. The current will flow
            around and bump with the underwater rocks and then a 10-metre high
            wave is formed and moves to the high rocks. This is a challenging
            activity of kayak and canoe paddlers who come and compete with each
            other at these rapids. Additionally, Driving an ATV on a thrilling
            nature trail is another activity that shouldn’t be missed.
