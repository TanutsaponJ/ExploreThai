            It can be said that March is a complete hot season of around 30-40°C
            throughout every region of Thailand. Despite the hot weather, there
            are still many amazing attractions with lots of fantastic activities
            like seas and Beaches in some provinces, which are perfect for the
            hot season of March. The festival held in this month is “Release
            Turtles into the Phang nga Sea” a traditional festival. Once the
            festival ends, Phang Nga’s sea trips start. Another choice is
            heading to the Northeastern region even without seas but with a rich
            and valuable Culture and traditions. Examples of traditional
            festivals are “Bun Phawet” or ‘Bun Mahachat” of Roi Et, which is a
            grand traditional event, held annually in March.

            The hot season completely comes in March and the weather is
            undeniably hot. This hot season is the time to dare to face the
            sunlight, jump into the water, and challenge the hot breeze. Start
            at ko Similan in Phang nga, which is the biggest Island of Mu Ko
            Similan. The sea is very clear and green like emerald, and the Beach
            looks white because of its fine sand. This place is perfect for
            water activities like diving to see the corals and exploring the
            beauty of the fish and sea turtles. Another highlight is the giant
            cliff rock with a panoramic viewpoint. Climb up there to appreciate
            the view with your own eyes. It’s phenomenal and no wonder why both
            Thai and foreign tourists continuously come to this place. Another
            festival also held in March is “Release Turtles into the Sea”, which
            attracts both Thai and foreign tourists. There are many activities;
            such as, the exhibition about how to conserve sea turtles, OTOP
            products for sale, some entertainment to enjoy during the
            night-time, etc. Besides Thale Phang nga, Phu Khao Ya in Ranong is
            another Landmark for you to dare the hot breeze during March. Phu
            Khao Ya are complex grass hills, which are entirely void of tress.
            During the rainy season, the grass turns green but in March, the
            grass turns gold and seems to dance in the hot breeze. It’s one of
            the beautiful places that’s totally unique. There are more
            challenging activities in March. Just having jumped into the water,
            Rafting, enjoying a waterfall excursion are such fantastic
            activities.

            Not only jumping into the water helps you decrease the heat in your
            body, but it’s also a good opportunity to appreciate the nature
            closely, let your eyes Relax by looking at the abundant green trees,
            relax your body and put your feet into the cold water, which is such
            an awesome and unforgettable experience. River Rafting can be done
            in many regions of Thailand; for example, at Srinagarind Dam,
            SaiYok, Thong Pha Phum, Kanchanaburi province; Rajjaprabha Dam,
            Surat Thani province; Patho Rafting, chumphon province; Sirindhorn
            Dam, Ubon Ratchathani province, or even in the North region that is
            Mae Ngat Dam, Chiang Mai province.

            Another activity that Adventure lovers can’t miss and is great to
            escape from the heat of March is “Cave Exploring at Lam Khlong Ngu
            national park” in Kanchanaburi, a place of abundant nature, both
            trees and wild animals. Its highlight is to conquer many huge caves
            situated in this area. The most popular caves are Sao Hin Cave and
            the Swallow’s Cave. The strength of the body and heart is needed to
            conquer them because of the difficult activities waiting ahead
            including Trekking, jumping and floating in the water. Some parts of
            the track are smooth while other parts are steep and full of rocks.
            It can be said that it’s absolutely a challenging place for
            adventurous travellers.
