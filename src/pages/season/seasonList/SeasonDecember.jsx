            When December comes, it’s the mid Cool season and the average
            temperature in Thailand is the lowest of the year, especially at the
            top of the mountains. Some places have a negative temperature and

            entrepreneurs are waiting for because the monsoon season has already
            gone, so every attraction can be visited both on the AnDaman Coast;
            such as, ko lipe, ko Tarutao in satun, Ko Muk, Ko Kradan, Ko Rok in
            Trang and other islands in Krabi, which are phenomenal and deserve
            the name “Queen of the AnDaman”. On the other side is the Gulf of
            Thailand coast, which is also extraordinary whether it be Ko Mak, Ko
            Kut, Ko Kradat, Ko Chang in Trat, Ko Talu, Ko Samet, Ko Man Nok in
