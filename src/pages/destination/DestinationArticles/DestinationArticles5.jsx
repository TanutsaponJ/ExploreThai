          <p className="Articles-text">
            Any visit to Ubon should begin at Thung Si Muang Park, a compact
            square in the center of the city that connects visitors to several
            points of interest: -The Candle sculpture in the center of the park,
            rising some 22 meters high from a boat adorned with a garuda (eagle)
            and naga (serpent). -Ubon Ratchathani National Museum, south of the
            park, is a century-old building that was Ubon’s City Hall before its
            conversion into a showcase of all things beautiful about the
            province. It includes geology, city history, and local handicrafts.
            -Wat Si Ubon Rattanaram, southwest of the park, is the city’s
            founding temple. It houses a Buddha image carved from a single topaz
            rock. -Wat Thung Si Muang, east of the park, is best known for its
            wooden scripture hall (Ho Trai) built in the middle of the pond to
            protect the wood structure from termites. From here, visitors can
            take a songthaew bus, tuk-tuk (an auto rickshaw) or samlor (a three
            wheeled bicycle with a cart for passengers) to the province’s key
            cultural stops, among them: Talat Yai Morning Market – is a talat
            sod (wet market) that sells fresh meat and produce for the local
            community. Visit for the authentic sights and sounds of locals going
            about their day and for a cheap local meal. Kham Pun – is a teak
            mansion housing a fabric museum, exposing tourists to the Isaan
            region’s best handmade crafts and their history. An adjoining cafe
            serves Thai-style cakes and coffee.

          <p className="Articles-text">
            Ubon Ratchathani’s temples – the top temples to visit include: -Wat
            Nong Pah Pong is a forest monastery founded by the late Ajahn Chah,
            one of Thailand’s most respected meditation masters. Pay your
            respects at the stupa and learn more about Chah in the museum
            dedicated to his memory. -Wat Sirindhorn Wararam’s southern wall
            bears a graceful ceramic-tile tree that glows in the dark after
            sunset. -Wat Tham Khuha Sawan, is home to Thailand’s largest gong
            and final resting place of a revered Buddhist monk.

              Ubon Ratchathani and the Emerald Triangle
            </h1>
            <p className="Articles-text">
              It may not look the part, but, alongside Udon Thani, Khorat, and
              Khon Kaen, Ubon Ratchathani is one of the Isaan Region’s “Big
              Four” cities. The capital city of Bangkok is some 630 km (395 mi)
              to the west of Ubon while the borders of both Cambodia and Laos
              are less than 100 km (65 mi) away. The “Emerald Triangle” where
              the three countries meet has long been known for its untamed
              landscapes, with striking mountain ranges and verdant jungles run
              through with rivers. To see just how wild the Emerald Triangle’s
              terrain can be, visit the area’s most striking natural formations:
              Phu Chong Na Yoi National Park covers some 680 sq. km at the
              eastern end of the Dângrêk Mountains (also known as the “carrying
              pole mountains”). Its signature sight, the Namtok Huai Luang
              waterfall, descends some 30 meters into a dazzlingly-blue pool
              with a white beach. Hiking trails throughout the park lead to rock
              gardens, streams, and mountaintop viewpoints. Pha Taem National
              Park is as untamed as it gets: a 340 sq. km park at the most
              eastward point of mainland Thailand, covered in deciduous
              dipterocarp forest. This park is home to Thailand’s largest flower
              field and Cha Na Dai Cliff, a viewpoint gazing over the Mekong and
              Laos beyond it. Every morning it is the first point to see
              daylight in Thailand. Certain caves in Pha Taem show signs of
              human habitation — specifically, prehistoric cave paintings that
              may be up to 4,000 years old. Maenam Song Si is the point where
              the Mun River meets the Mekong, and the rivers blend. The Mekong’s
              reddish-brown current clashes with the Mun’s bluish waves. In the
              dry season, the gorge of Sam Pan Boak reveals the beautiful
              consequences of erosion and time: a channel carved through
              sandstone that’s been called a smaller version of the Grand
              Canyon.

              Ubon Ratchathani’s Candle Festival
            </h1>
            <p className="Articles-text">
              The beginning of Buddhist Lent — Khao Phansa, usually in late July
              — sees Ubon at its most festive. The Candle Festival sees off
              Buddhist monks to their annual rainy-season retreat with parades
              featuring beeswax sculptures depicting scenes from Buddhist and
              Hindu lore. Tourists can see these candles being made at Wat
              Pholphaen, Wat Thungsrimuang, and Wat Sripradoo. Then, they can
              watch the parade start from Wat Si Ubon Rattanaram and end at
              Thung Sri Muang Park. During the Candle Festival, the Thai-style
              mansion complex of Ban Khampun opens to the public with cultural
              performances, silk-weaving demonstrations, and other events
              gracing the beautiful mansion grounds and interiors.

            <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Food in Ubon Ratchathani</h1>
            <p className="Articles-text">
              Ubon Ratchathani is also famous for its food. Known as Isaan
              cuisine, there are many famous dishes that are common in Ubon
              Ratchathani. You may have heard of larb, a dish made of a minced
              protein such as chicken, pork, duck, or beef, mixed with
              vegetables such as shallots and onions, and seasoned with chili
              and lime. Another popular dish, the Isaan sausage is a flavorful
              fermented pork sausage. In the winter months, it is common to find
              khao gee, sticky rice that is shaped into balls or circles and
              then basted in egg and salt and double grilled. The dish is said
              to be perfect for the cooler seasons because it will warm you up
              as you enjoy it. Another must-try is the mok. Mok is made with
              curry and lemon basil seasoned meat or vegetables that are cooked
              in a banana leaf by either steaming or grilling. What makes this
              dish so unique is that it can be cooked with ant larva, fish,
              tadpoles, or roe as its main ingredient.

              How to Get to Ubon Ratchathani and the Best Time to Visit
            </h1>

            <p className="Articles-text">
              Several daily flights from Bangkok’s Don Mueang and Suvarnabhumi
              Airports take about an hour to cover the distance from the capital
              to Ubon Ratchathani Airport. Flat-rate taxis and tuk-tuks are
              available at the arrivals area, ready to whisk you to your hotel.
              Buses from Bangkok leave from their terminal near Mo Chit BTS,
              taking 10 hours to cover the distance. Train services from Bangkok
              connect the capital to the Southern Isaan provincial capitals and
              the Ubon station can be found in the Warin Chamrap district.
              Songthaews and buses connect arriving tourists from either station
              to the city center. The Candle Festival is Ubon Ratchathani’s most
              visited time of the year, so book your tickets far in advance if
              you plan to come in July. A songthaew network travels on fixed
              routes around Ubon Ratchathani. You can distinguish them by their
              colors and the number codes affixed to the front. A map and route
              guide can be picked up at the Tourism Authority of Thailand office
              in Ubon Ratchathani.
