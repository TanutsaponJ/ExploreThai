As Ao Sane Beach is not as known as the popular beaches on the island, it is a great option to consider if you want to escape the bustling crowds. The beach is off the beaten path, but that does not mean it doesn’t offer many great attractions. Our favorite, by far, is the vibrant coral reef and a hidden viewpoint. As a result, it is not a surprise the most popular activity at the beach is snorkeling. The happy news is that you don’t need to bring your snorkeling gear. The beachfront restaurant and nearby shops offer equipment rental services for snorkeling. To reach Ao Sane Beach, you can take a taxi or rent a car. Another great option is renting a scooter, as the beach is tucked away from the main road. ",

The crescent-shaped beach, with its 8 km, is one of the longest in Phuket, but also one of the calmest. As a result, there are not many sports activities or shops. However, if you fancy a drink or Thai food, head to the south of the beach, filled with charming little traditional restaurants. Although Bang Tao might be the calmest beach so far, it still has many Thai beach clubs in the south. These beach clubs offer a blend of relaxation and entertainment, with comfortable loungers, refreshing cocktails, and stunning ocean views. Relax under the swaying palm trees, take a stroll along the shoreline, or indulge in traditional Thai food.
